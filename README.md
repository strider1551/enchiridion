# Enchiridion

## Intent

The spiritual masters of the Catholic Church's long history have left writings of great wisdom and insight, grown out of their own experience of God present in their lives.
Unfortunately, and perhaps by the very nature of the writing, they rarely pass on a condense, organized, and structured accounts of their thought.

This enchiridion hopes to do so.

## Principles

1. As little interpretation as possible is to be inserted. The objective should always be to express the original author's meaning in the most direct way possible.
2. All statements should be thoroughly cited. In addition to the obvious benefit, this helps to replace interpretation with reference.

## Methodology

The resulting document(s) must be high quality not only in content but in form. As such, they are written using XeLaTeX and with quality, freely usable fonts.
